# ‚úÇÔ∏è‚ú® ClipNova: AI-Powered Content Repurposing Platform

**ClipNova** is a project aiming to automate and simplify the process of transforming long-form video and audio content (like podcasts, webinars, interviews) into engaging, short, viral-ready clips for social media and other platforms. Inspired by the functionality of tools , ClipNova is being built to empower content creators, marketers, and businesses to maximize their reach and engagement with minimal effort.

This repository contains the core codebase for the ClipNova platform, including the frontend user interface and the backend API designed to handle user management, job processing, and integration with AI and media processing tools.


## üí° Project Goal & Vision

The manual process of finding highlights, transcribing, editing, and adding captions to create short clips is time-consuming and tedious. ClipNova aims to solve this by providing an intelligent platform that can:

1.  Automatically transcribe audio/video content.
2.  Utilize AI to identify the most engaging or important moments.
3.  Automatically generate ready-to-share short video clips with captions.
4.  Provide a user-friendly interface to manage content and review/edit generated clips.

This project is under active development, building the foundational components and progressively integrating the complex media processing and AI capabilities required for the full vision.

## ‚ú® Envisioned Key Features

The planned features for ClipNova include:

*   **Content Input:** Upload video/audio files or potentially link to online sources (e.g., YouTube, public URLs).
*   **Automated Transcription:** Accurate speech-to-text conversion of the input content.
*   **AI Highlight Detection:** Intelligent analysis to pinpoint viral moments, key takeaways, or engaging quotes.
*   **Automated Clip Generation:** Automatically cut and assemble short video clips based on detected highlights.
*   **Captioning & Text Overlay:** Automatically add synchronized captions to the generated clips.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure accounts to manage your content and processing jobs.
*   **Job Management:** Track the progress of content processing and manage generated clips.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and efficient interface for managing content and outputs (built with React).
*   **Configurable Output:** Options for output format, aspect ratio, and caption styling (Planned).


## üíª Technology Stack

The codebase in this repository is built upon the following technologies:

**Frontend (Client):**
*   React: For building the user interface.
*   Tailwind CSS: For flexible and fast styling.
*   React Router: For client-side navigation.
*   Vite: Development build tool.

**Backend (API):**
*   Flask: Micro web framework for the API.
*   Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interactions.
*   Flask-JWT-Extended: Handles user authentication.
*   Flask-CORS: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   Python-dotenv: Manages environment variables.
*   *(Future/Planned):* Integration with media processing libraries (e.g., FFmpeg bindings) and specific AI/ML models or APIs for transcription and analysis.

**Database:**
*   PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing user data, job information, and clip metadata.

**Development/Deployment Environment:**
*   Docker & Docker Compose: For containerization and orchestrating services (Database, API, Client).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ClipNova follows a typical client-server architecture:

*   The **Frontend** (`Client/`) is a React application running in the user's browser, providing the UI.
*   The **Backend** (`API/`) is a Flask application that handles API requests, user authentication, database interactions, and *initiates* the content processing jobs.
*   The **Database** (PostgreSQL) stores persistent data.
*   The complex **Processing Engine** (primarily within the Backend or as separate worker services - *currently under development/integration*) takes the raw content, performs transcription, AI analysis, editing, and generates the final clips.

The `docker-compose.yml` file facilitates running these core components together in isolated containers.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The project is organized into the main application components:

*   `API/`: Flask backend source code.
*   `Client/`: React frontend source code.
*   `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for the environment.
